The [probability and statistics cookbook][stat-cookbook] contains a succinct
representation of various topics in probability theory and statistics. It
provides a comprehensive mathematical reference reduced to its essence, rather
than aiming for elaborate explanations.

Feel encouraged to extend the cookbook by forking it and submitting pull
requests.

Build Setup
-----------

You can build the cookbook locally via:

    make
  guaranteed to work: see the documentation to `unload()` for caveats.

* `build()` builds a package file from package sources. You can
  use it to build a binary version of your package.

* `install_*` functions install an R package:
   * `install_github()` from github,
   * `install_bitbucket()` from bitbucket, 
   * `install_url()` from an arbitrary url and
   * `install_local()` from a local file on disk. 
   * `install_version()` installs a specified version from cran.

Check and release:

* `check()` updates the documentation, then builds and checks the package. 
  `build_win()` builds a package using 
  [win-builder](http://win-builder.r-project.org/), allowing you to easily check 
  your package on windows.

* `run_examples()` will run all examples to make sure they work.
  This is useful because example checking is the last step of `R CMD check`.

* `check_man()` runs most of the documentation checking components
  of `R CMD check`

* `release()` makes sure everything is ok with your package
  (including asking you a number of questions), then builds and
  uploads to CRAN. It also drafts an email to let the CRAN
  maintainers know that you've uploaded a new package.

## Diaspora

devtools started off as a lean-and-mean package to facilitate local package development, but over the years it accumulated more and more functionality. Currently devtools is under going a diaspora to split out functionality into smaller, more tightly focussed packages. The diaspora includes:

* [pkgbuild](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgbuild): Building binary packages
  (including checking if build tools are available).

* [pkgload](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgload): Simulating package loading 
  (i.e. `load_all()`)

* [rcmdcheck](https://github.com/r-lib/rcmdcheck): Running R CMD check
  and reporting the results.

This first generates the distribution plots via R and then compiles the LaTeX source.
You may have to install a few missing packages via CRAN.
